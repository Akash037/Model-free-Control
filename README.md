# Model-free-Control
This code is to implement the model-free control algorithm as introduced in the paper 
Model-free control by Michel Fliess and Cedric Join (link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.7085.pdf)

Code is in MATLAB. The file Main_MFC_sample.m is the main file. It has a sample first order system, 
the controller is iP (as in the paper) and the tuning values are specific to this sample system.

The file MFC.m is the function contaning the code for the Model-free control.
